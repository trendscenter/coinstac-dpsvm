"""Script run at the remote site.

At iteration 0, run remote_0(): Aggregates classifiers from local sites, saves 
    and sends them to the owner site.
At iteration 1, run remote_1(): Receives an aggregator classifier from the 
    owner site and outputs classifiers and perfomance metrics of both owner 
    and local sites.

Raises:
    Exception: If neither 'local_0' nor 'local_1' is in sys.stdin.
